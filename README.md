VXKonsol is building a Rofi‑style search palette for Windows 10/11, aiming to instantly launch apps, files, or web results. Envisioned as a personal command centre—keyboard‑first and plugin‑ready—it's an open-source project where contributions are highly encouraged to help realize its full potential for power users who hate hunting through menus.
